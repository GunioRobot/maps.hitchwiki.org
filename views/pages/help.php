<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is supposed to be a worldmap for hitchhikers, showing good and bad hitching places. Feel free to add all your favourite hitching places (or even more) to the map.</p>

<h3>How can I add points?</h3>
<p>Just click on 'Add point' in the menu. Set the red marker to the place and click on save. Make sure to zoom as close as possible, so the point will be more accurate. It is also helpful if you give your points a rating and maybe a little description (i.e. what kind of place this is or how to get there).</p>

<h3>Why should I sign up?</h3>
<p>If you are logged in, you will have some more features on this site. I.e. you will be able to modify your points later, and your nickname will be shown on each of your points.</p>

<h3>Why is the map always centered to Paris?</h3>
<p>If you have registered, you can set a point of the type 'home' to where you live. The map will center there whenever you log in.</p>
