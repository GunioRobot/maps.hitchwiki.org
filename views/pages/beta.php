Good day to you all. It was about time to take our great Maps service and make it even better! And shiny! And orange.
<br /><br />
This new Maps will be published soon. There still are some bugs and testing to be done, so go ahead, try it!
<br  /><br />
You can comment <a href="http://hitchwiki.org/en/Hitchwiki:Maps">to the Wiki</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=133644853341506&share_id=167990209881312&comments=1#s167990209881312">in Facebook</a>.
<br /><br />
You can do whatever you want to - try to crash it! The database will be reset afterwards.
<br  /><br />
It's not anymore just about you and your hitchhiking places, but everybody can comment, rate and contribute. Just like in our Wiki. Still it's not Facebook... it's not blue you know. We tried our best to make it as usable and good (and orange) as possible.
<br /><br />
We now also have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hitchwiki/133644853341506" title="Go to Facebook">Hitchwiki Facebook Page</a>, to where you can join in and get recent updates about Hitchwiki.
<br /><br />
Ok. Ta. Be well.
